  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><b>Last updated:</b> 2026-02-02</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <div class="box">
    <b>Important:</b> The App includes an <b>AI-powered chat</b>. Messages you send in AI chat are transmitted to an AI provider to generate replies.
    Please <b>do not share personal information</b> (phone numbers, addresses, passwords, banking details) in AI chat.
  </div>

  <h2>1) What data we collect</h2>
  <p>Depending on which features you use, the App may process the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>AI Chat Messages (User-generated content):</b> text you type in AI chat and limited recent chat history needed to generate a reply.</li>
    <li><b>App activity:</b> basic interactions (e.g., which screen you opened) for analytics/performance.</li>
    <li><b>Device identifiers (Advertising ID):</b> used for showing ads and measuring ad performance (if ads are enabled).</li>
    <li><b>Approximate location (optional):</b> may be derived by advertising/analytics partners to show relevant ads and prevent fraud (this may be based on IP/region or device signals). We do not require precise GPS location unless the App requests it via Android permissions.</li>
    <li><b>Diagnostics:</b> crash logs and performance data (if analytics/crash reporting SDKs are enabled).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Camera, Microphone, Storage permissions</h2>
  <p>The App may request device permissions depending on features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Camera/Microphone:</b> for call simulation features if enabled in the App. We do not upload camera or microphone recordings to our servers unless explicitly stated in the App.</li>
    <li><b>Photos/Media (Storage):</b> only if the App includes features that let you pick images from your device. If your current App version does not include this, you should remove this line.</li>
    <li><b>Location:</b> only if the App explicitly requests location permission. If not requested, ads/analytics may still use approximate location derived from IP/region.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Provide AI chat:</b> send your AI chat message to an AI provider to generate a response.</li>
    <li><b>App functionality:</b> run call simulation and chat features.</li>
    <li><b>Advertising:</b> display ads and measure their performance (if ads are enabled).</li>
    <li><b>Analytics & stability:</b> understand app usage and fix crashes.</li>
    <li><b>Safety:</b> prevent abuse, enforce content rules, and handle user reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) When we share data</h2>
  <p>We may share data with the following categories of partners:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>AI providers</b> to generate AI chat responses (your message and limited context are sent to the provider).</li>
    <li><b>Advertising partners</b> (e.g., Google AdMob) to display ads and measure performance.</li>
    <li><b>Analytics / crash reporting</b> (e.g., Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics) to monitor app performance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Note:</b> Partner data handling may be governed by their own policies.</p>

  <h2>5) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Chat history:</b> stored locally on your device unless stated otherwise.</li>
    <li><b>AI chat requests:</b> transmitted to AI providers to generate replies. Providers may retain data for a limited time according to their policies.</li>
    <li><b>Diagnostics/analytics:</b> retained as needed to improve stability and prevent fraud.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear the App’s local data or uninstall the App to remove locally stored chat history.</li>
    <li>You can manage permissions (Camera/Microphone/Location/Photos) in Android Settings.</li>
    <li>You can limit ad personalization in your device settings (where supported).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures such as encryption in transit (HTTPS) when communicating with partners and services.</p>

  <h2>8) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>9) Contact</h2>
