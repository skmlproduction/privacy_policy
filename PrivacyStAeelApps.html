  <h1>Privacy Policy — StAeel Apps</h1>
  <p><b>Last updated:</b> 2026-02-02</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how StAeel Apps (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and shares information
    when you use our mobile application (the “App”).
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <b>Important — AI Chat:</b> The App includes an <b>AI-powered chat simulation</b>.
    When you use AI chat, the text you type (and limited recent chat context) is transmitted to an AI provider to generate replies.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Please do not share personal information</b> in AI chat (e.g., phone numbers, home addresses, passwords, banking details).
    <br/><br/>
    <span class="muted">
      The App is for entertainment and simulation purposes. Characters shown in the App are not real people inside the App,
      and the App is not affiliated with any celebrities, brands, or organizations unless explicitly stated.
    </span>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Information we process</h2>
  <p>Depending on the features you use, the App may process the following categories of data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>AI Chat Messages (User-generated content):</b>
      Text you type in AI chat and a limited portion of recent chat history needed to generate a response.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>App activity:</b> Basic interactions with the App (e.g., screen views, feature usage) for analytics and performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Device identifiers (Advertising ID):</b> Used to display ads and measure ad performance (if ads are enabled).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Approximate location (optional):</b> May be derived by advertising/analytics partners to show relevant ads and help prevent fraud.
      This is typically based on IP/region or device signals. We do not collect precise GPS location unless the App explicitly requests it via Android permissions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Diagnostics:</b> Crash logs and performance data (if analytics/crash reporting SDKs are enabled).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Permissions (Camera, Microphone, Photos/Media, Location)</h2>
  <p>The App may request device permissions depending on features you use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Camera / Microphone:</b> Used for call simulation features when enabled by you in the App.
      We do not upload camera or microphone recordings to our servers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Photos / Media (Storage):</b> Used only to let you select images from your device when you use features that require it
      (for example, choosing a photo for customization).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Location:</b> Only if the App explicitly requests location permission. If the App does not request it, ads/analytics may still use approximate location derived from IP/region.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How we use information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Provide AI chat:</b> Send your AI chat message (and limited context) to an AI provider to generate a response.</li>
    <li><b>App functionality:</b> Provide chat simulation, video call simulation, and audio call simulation features.</li>
    <li><b>Advertising:</b> Display ads and measure ad performance (if ads are enabled).</li>
    <li><b>Analytics & stability:</b> Understand usage, improve performance, and fix crashes.</li>
    <li><b>Safety & abuse prevention:</b> Enforce content rules and handle user reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) AI content, moderation & user reports</h2>
  <p>
    AI responses are generated automatically and may be inaccurate or inappropriate. We implement safety measures to reduce harmful content,
    including content filters and rate limiting.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App also provides an in-app reporting mechanism so users can report offensive or unsafe AI-generated messages.
    Report data may include the reported message content and your selected report reason, which we use to investigate and improve safety.
  </p>

  <h2>5) When we share information</h2>
  <p>We may share information with the following categories of service providers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>AI providers:</b> To generate AI chat responses (your message and limited context are sent to the provider).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Advertising partners:</b> (e.g., Google AdMob) to display ads, measure performance, and help prevent fraud.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Analytics / crash reporting:</b> (e.g., Firebase Analytics / Crashlytics) to monitor performance and stability.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>We do not sell your personal data.</b> Partners may process data under their own privacy policies and terms.</p>

  <h2>6) Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Chat history:</b> Stored locally on your device unless stated otherwise in the App.</li>
    <li>
      <b>AI chat requests:</b> Transmitted to AI providers to generate replies.
      AI providers may retain data for a limited period according to their own policies.
    </li>
    <li><b>Diagnostics/analytics:</b> Retained as needed to improve stability, measure performance, and prevent fraud.</li>
    <li><b>Reports:</b> Retained as needed to investigate safety issues and improve content filtering.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Your choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can clear the App’s local data or uninstall the App to remove locally stored chat history.</li>
    <li>You can manage permissions (Camera/Microphone/Location/Photos) in Android Settings.</li>
    <li>You can limit ad personalization in your device settings (where supported).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures such as encryption in transit (HTTPS) when communicating with partners and services.</p>

  <h2>9) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
